## 2. Environment setup

Python 3.10–3.12 (the reported results were produced with CPython 3.12 on Windows 11).

```bash
cd <repo root>
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:      .venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements.txt
# Linux/macOS:  .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. One-command-sequence reproduction

Run the stages **in this order** (each stage checkpoints its outputs into `results_geo/`;
trained AutoGluon models are saved under `models/`, which is created automatically):

```bash
# --- data & features -----------------------------------------------------
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py rebuild      # 81-point long table + audit + geo features
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py features     # leakage-safe temporal features + static merge

# --- simple baselines (Reviewer 2 #2, Reviewer 5 #7) ---------------------
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py baselines    # persistence / rate extrapolation / AR(5)

# --- main models ----------------------------------------------------------
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py main         # temporal-only 16 features, seed 2024
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py main_geo     # PROPOSED MODEL: temporal + geological, 30 features

# --- ablation ladder (Reviewer 2 #4, Reviewer 5 #4) -----------------------
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py ablation A   # 5 single-cycle lags only
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py ablation B   # + 5 cumulative lags
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py ablation C   # + 3 dynamic indicators
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py ablation D   # + interval days / timestep (= temporal-only full)
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py ablation E   # + 14 geological/mining features (= proposed model)

# --- robustness: 10 extra seeds on the proposed model (Reviewer 1 #1) -----
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py seed 1
# ... repeat for seeds 2 .. 10

# --- spatial cross-validation, leave-one-zone-out (Reviewer 3 #10, R5 #7) --
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py cv K21
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py cv K22
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py cv K23
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py cv JPK
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py cv RAMP

# --- window-length sensitivity & a second forecast date (Reviewer 2 #1, R3 #2) --
.venv/Scripts/python run_window4.py w4s8    # 4-session window, same protocol (S6 train / S7 calib / S8 test)
.venv/Scripts/python run_window4.py w4s7    # 4-session window, shifted one session earlier (S5 / S6 / S7)

# --- prediction intervals & permutation importance -------------------------
# (these two load the trained models/ag_main_geo — run main_geo first)
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py intervals    # split-conformal 90% intervals
.venv/Scripts/python run_pipeline_geo.py importance   # permutation importance, 20 shuffles

# --- aggregate everything into tables + figures ----------------------------
python make_report_geo.py   # system python with pandas+matplotlib is enough
```

**Runtime**: each AutoGluon fit is capped at `time_limit = 100 s` (documented);
the full sequence above takes ≈ 45–70 min on a desktop CPU. No GPU is required.
`baselines`, `intervals`, `importance` and `make_report_geo.py` finish in seconds.

## 6. Data provenance statement

The monitoring data were transcribed from the four settlement-observation
summary tables on pp. 121–124 of the construction-stage goaf investigation report
(Goaf Investigation for the Zhengzhou–Luoyang Expressway construction design, Aug 2022):
81 points (C1–C81) × 8 sessions (2021-12-10 … 2022-07-16) = 648 records. Increments
are kept as the primary truth; cumulative displacement is reconstructed as the
running sum of increments (67.3% of the reported cumulative values match the
cumulated increments within ±0.05 mm; 100% within 0.2 mm — see
`results_geo/data_audit_real.json`).

Static geological/mining features (mining method and room/pillar geometry, mining
depth, seam thickness, overburden lithology, dip angle, recovery rate, years since
abandonment, mine ownership, stability class) are assigned per point from
survey-report Tables 4.6.1/5.1.4 and Sections 4.1/5.1.5; the point-by-point
assignment and its evidence are documented in
`data/C1-C81_geology_mining_mapping.xlsx`. **No cement grouting or any other
ground reinforcement was applied in the monitored area during the monitoring
window (2021-11 ~ 2022-07)** — the `grouting` feature is a documented constant 0;
the grouting schemes in the report are post-monitoring treatment recommendations.

## 7. Notes

- `models/` (trained AutoGluon artifacts, several hundred MB) is **not** shipped;
  it is regenerated by the `main*` / `ablation` / `seed` / `cv` stages. The
  `intervals` and `importance` stages require `models/ag_main_geo`, i.e. run
  `main_geo` before them.
- All figures and tables use English labels only.
- Torch warnings ("Failed to import torch …") may appear during AutoGluon fits;
  they are harmless — no neural-network learner is used in the documented
  13-learner configuration.
